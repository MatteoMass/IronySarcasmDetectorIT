# Notebooks / models
The following notebooks contain the code used to develop
and test the models.

The notebooks have been developed on Google [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/),
so in order to run them and have all imports and dependencies work, it is better to upload the notebooks
on the platform and run them on it.

Each notebook has been named according to the model developed in it.
The number of outputs, where present, indicates the number of outputs of the model.

We tried solving the tasks by predicting both targets simultaneously and separately.
The best results where obtained when predicting simultaneously.
